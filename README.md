# ChessGame 2D (C++)
ChessGame 2D is a personal C++ project built from scratch to explore game architecture and modern C++ practices.  
It features a custom chess engine with full rule validation, turn and state management, and a clean object-oriented design.

# Features
- Full chess rules (legal moves, captures, turns)
- Supported CPU mode (play agains computer).
- Drag and drop of 2D pieces.
- Capture pieces
- Calculate possible position for each piece.
- Pawn promotion
- Turn-based system
- Check / Checkmate positions
- Piece-oriented architecture (Piece, Pawn, Queen, King, etc.)
- Custom game logic and validation
- 2D rendering (Raylib)
- Board representation (grid-based)
- Supported game modes: Bullet, Blitz, and Rapid.
- Settings can be selected before starting the game.


# Project Goals
- Problem solving, (project built from scratch).
- Practice modern C++ (OOP, polymorphism, smart pointers, inheritance, interfaces, STL containers)
- Clean architecture & separation of concerns
- Build a clean and extensible chess engine
- Separate game logic from rendering and input handling
- Memory management

# Technologies
- C++ 17
- Raylib (2D rendering & input)
- STL (`std::vector`, `std::unique_ptr`, etc.)
